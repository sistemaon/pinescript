## The 12 Moving Average Length by Year Cycle.
* As the name mention, is a 12 moving averages, in which the first ma length is 365.
* The others are subsequently divided by the length of months, **MA = daysInYear / month**.
* Having this MA length pattern, _365, 182, 121, 91, 73, 60, 52, 45, 40, 36, 33, 30_.

## Candle Wick Weekly
* Check in week graph for an wick candle (doji, weak candle).
* In day graph use 1-2-3 pattern to buy/enter when in UTL (uptrend line).
* In day graph use 1-2-3 pattern to sell/exit buy when in UTL (uptrend line).
* In day graph use 1-2-3 pattern to sell/enter when in DTL (downtrend line).
* In day graph use 1-2-3 pattern to buy/exit sell when in DTL (downtrend line).
* May use MA length 50 to help to define trend lines.

## Week High Movimentation
* Check the asset if has volume of at least 1 million.
* Check the asset has change (%) greater than 10% in the last 7 days (week). Ex; Asset with 13.21%
* Check the asset in daily graph change (%) for correction. Ex; Asset with 2.16%
* Enter position in a smaller timeframe (240 minutes).
* Check for 1-2-3 pattern to enter long or short.
* Enter postion when pierces the low or high at the identified pattern.
* May use an increse of 27% for stop loss regarding the price entered position.
* May use moving average of 80 and 8 to help to define trend to enter position.
* MA80 will work as market direction and MA8 will work as recoil/indent and point to same direction as MA80.

## Moving average Slow Stoch Offset
* MA of 80 above MA of 80 offset (ma80 > ma80[1]). Long.
* Slow Stoch of 8 less or iqual as 20, crossing 20. Long.
* MA of 80 below MA of 80 offset (ma80 > ma80[1]). Short.
* Slow Stoch of 8 greater or iqual as 80, crossing 80. Long.
* Stoch Slow broke the 50 line, then pulled back still 50 or above and crossed, it may be an enter position.
* If bullish pivot is seen in Stoch Slow, may use 1-2-3 pattern to go long.
* If bearish pivot is seen in Stoch Slow, may use 1-2-3 pattern to go short.
* May use Stoch Slow in a higher timeframe (120/240 minutes) and in a smaller timeframe (6/12/30 minutes) may look for entries.
* Stoch Slow direction up is long, and down is short.
* May use 15 Renko to look for entries.

## Candle Wick Open Price
* 3D+ chart.
* Intraday chart.
* Moving Averages to define trends.
* Candle wick pattern (previous candle), distance between open price and close price less than candle total range.

#### Randoms
> Have strategy for trend following and another for volatility.

> Limit burner 14% stocks, 27% cryptos.

> To define a longer stop loss, if price break uptrend moving average, fetch the last 1-2-3 price pattern buy.

> If break downtrend moving average, fetch the last 1-2-3 price pattern sell.

> Inside bar pattern formed with stochastic (in region overbought/oversold).

> The last 7 days having a strong movement and the last 24 hours having a correction, volume +1kk.

> Slow stochastic use to define trend (long or short) higher timeframe chart (120 mins),
> slow stochastic to use with moving averages to help identify support and resistance and trends,
> slow stochastic use to enter and exit positions (long or short) lower timeframe chart (6 mins),
> may use lower timeframe Renko chart to enter and exit positions.
> Stoch when hit its overbought/oversold area, start to follow and check their higher/lower price wick for possible break up, when it breaks the wick price (ex; higher), enter position, stop is the reverse wick price (ex; lower).
> Stoch when hit its overbought/oversold area like mentioned, before entering position, check candle if its long/short favoring the stoch area and use the price wick to enter (ex; sotch is overbought region, if candle is long use the price higher wick candle to enter position, if its short candle do nothing).

> Traps from the previous day candle maximum and minimum,
> traps from the previous support and resistance,
> traps from the long MAs.
> In traps, may compared the current lower/higher wick with previous candles.

> Bear trap is onto MA 80.
> Fox trap is onto MA 8.

> Max & Min, 60 minute timeframe chart, exit is target or closed 3rd candle.
> Max & Min, daily timeframe chart, exit is target or the first closed candle giving any profit.
> Stop closed candle can be the 1st.

> Define a long campaing, when price crosses above the 50 MA and then the price pulls back and sits above onto MA making a bottom. Short campaing is reverse.

> SLS (short long short) is a trend pattern, when having 2 MAs pointing up, 3 candles short long short, entry point the highest price from candles higher wick, stop point the lowest price from candles lower wick.
> LSL (long short long) is a trend pattern, when having 2 MAs pointing down, 3 candles long short long, entry point the lowest price from candles lower wick, stop point the highest price from candles higher wick.
> May use renko chart for this system.

> When appearing an elephant bar, can wait pull make and mark support and resistance regions.

> May use 1-2-3 higher/lower wick price to mark region as support and/or resistance.

> Mark hammer higher/lower price in a trend to help identify the stop prices.
> May use 2 MAs (ex; 8, 80) to identify trend.

> Use inside bar extension/amplitute to help define target and/or stop.

> RSI (2) dropped to 25 buy, exit is the max of the last 2 candles or 7 days later.
> Daily day timeframe chart.

#### Q&D

> Since ADX helps to identify directional or fragile market movements, can it operate maxs and mins?
