## Week High Movimentation

* Enter position in a smaller timeframe (240 minutes).

* MA80 will work as market direction and MA8 will work as recoil/indent and point to same direction as MA80.

## Moving average Slow Stoch Offset
* MA of 80 above MA of 80 offset (ma80 > ma80[1]). Long.
* Slow Stoch of 8 less or iqual as 20, crossing 20. Long.

* Slow Stoch of 8 greater or iqual as 80, crossing 80. Long.
* Stoch Slow broke the 50 line, then pulled back still 50 or above and crossed, it may be an enter position.
