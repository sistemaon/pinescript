# Candlestick Patterns

## Spinning Top
The Spinning Top is a candlestick pattern representing market indecision. This pattern occurs when the real body (the difference between the open and close prices) of the candle is small compared to its overall range (the difference between the high and low prices). The Spinning Top pattern can be either bullish or bearish, depending on the direction of the real body.
They have small upper and lower shadows, but the size of the shadows are not important.
It is the diminutive size of the real body that makes this a spinning top.
